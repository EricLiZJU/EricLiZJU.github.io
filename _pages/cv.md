Education
======
* Ph.D. in Computational Social Science (Public Administration / Computer Science), **Zhejiang University**, 2023–present (expected Jun 2028). Focus: deep learning & foundation models applied to social data. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}  
* B.Eng. in Automation, **Harbin Institute of Technology**, Jun 2023. Honors: CUMCM National Second Prize; Honors Bachelor (Elite College); First-Class Scholarship. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Experience
======
* **Daily Interactive (Getui)** — Data Analytics & Modeling Intern (University–Industry Collaboration), *Mar 2025–present*  
  - Built event-aware spatiotemporal prediction and region-recommendation models from city/date/app behavioral data.  
  - Implemented feature engineering and batch processing with Spark + PostgreSQL; developed dynamic-graph GNN + Transformer pipelines and evaluated recommendation effectiveness. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

* **Shibei Investment** — Quantitative Research Intern, *Sep 2024–Dec 2024*  
  - In the Qlib backtesting framework with daily A-share data, engineered factor sets and performed data cleaning & preprocessing.  
  - Used SHAP for factor screening/feature engineering to enhance interpretability and reduce redundancy; compared deep models for return prediction and integrated outputs into factor backtests and portfolio construction (Sharpe, Max Drawdown, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Skills
======
* **Programming:** Python (pandas/numpy/numba, PyTorch, statsmodels, scikit-learn), Linux, basic C++.  
* **Data:** PostgreSQL, Spark, Parquet/Arrow.
