Education
======
* Ph.D. in Computational Social Science (Public Administration / Computer Science), **Zhejiang University**, 2023–present (expected Jun 2028). Focus: deep learning & LLM applied to social data. 
* B.Eng. in Automation, **Harbin Institute of Technology**, 2019-2023. 

Experience
======
* **Getui** — Data Analytics & Modeling Intern (University–Industry Collaboration), *Mar 2025–Sept 2025*  
  - Built event-aware spatiotemporal prediction and region-recommendation models from city/date/app behavioral data.  
  - Implemented feature engineering and batch processing with Spark + PostgreSQL; developed dynamic-graph GNN + Transformer pipelines and evaluated recommendation effectiveness. 

* **Shibei Investment** — Quantitative Research Intern, *Sep 2024–Dec 2024*  
  - In the Qlib backtesting framework with daily A-share data, engineered factor sets and performed data cleaning & preprocessing.  
  - Used SHAP for factor screening/feature engineering to enhance interpretability and reduce redundancy; compared deep models for return prediction and integrated outputs into factor backtests and portfolio construction (Sharpe, Max Drawdown, etc.).

Skills
======
* **Programming:** Python (pandas/numpy/numba, PyTorch, statsmodels, scikit-learn), Linux, basic C++.  
* **Data:** PostgreSQL, Spark, Parquet/Arrow.  
* **Quant:** factor discovery (cross-sectional regressions, IC/ICIR, long-short backtests), time-series (ARIMA/GARCH/VAR), Qlib.  
* **ML / CV / NLP & LLMs:** LoRA fine-tuning for Qwen, OpenCV, common deep learning architectures.  
* **Tools:** Git, Docker, LaTeX, Markdown, MATLAB.

Selected Projects
======
* **Multi-task Time-Series Models for FX Forecasting** — Zhejiang University  
  - Joint modeling of multiple currency pairs with macro & micro features; ~15% RMSE reduction vs. ARIMA/GARCH and improved robustness under extreme volatility.
* **Multimodal LLMs + Market Sentiment Factors** — Zhejiang University  
  - LoRA-tuned LLMs fusing text, image, and audio to build sentiment factors for volatility prediction and risk early warning.
* **Lightweight Modular 3D-CNN for High-Dimensional Classification** — Zhejiang University  
  - +0.3–0.6% accuracy on 8 datasets with >30% parameter reduction and faster training.

Awards & Honors
======
* HIT Honors Bachelor (Elite College) and First-Class Scholarship. (2023)
* CUMCM National Second Prize. (2021)
