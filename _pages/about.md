I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Zhejiang University, based at the Center for Interdisciplinary Studies of Humanities and Sciences. I received my B.Eng. degree in Automation from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2023, and have been pursuing my doctoral studies since then.

My research focuses on the intersection of Computer Science, Social Science, and Quantitative Finance, with an emphasis on fundamental computational approaches. Specifically, I am interested in natural language processing (NLP), deep learning, reinforcement learning, agent-based modeling, and quantitative trading strategies, and how these methods can be applied to analyze and model complex social and economic systems.
